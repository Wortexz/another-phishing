# Another Phishing Tactic using "Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Voice"

Hello hello everyone - another day, another phishing tactic.

Everything starts with a hacked mailbox account.  

Today we have Microsoft accounts hacked and using their email account hackers started sending phishing emails.

# How hackers are trying to bypass email security?
* By using hacked, legit business email accounts (in this example Microsoft).
* Hacked Business Microsoft SharePoint or other legitimate business systems to upload the malware.
* Using Microsoft Encryption feature to encrypt malicious documents (nice).
* Using "Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Voice".

## Clicking on phishing URL (do it only in a secure environment - VM)  
**When we click on Microsoft short URL we are redirected to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Voice pages**  

Customer Voice is designed to collect feedback from customers, but attackers are using it to send phony links.
